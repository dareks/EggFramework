Quick start
-----------

 * Download IDE - I recommend Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers - http://eclipse.org
 * Install Maven plugin if needed (Netbeans and Intellij IDEA have Maven support out of the box) - for Eclipse use the update site of M2E plugin: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases
 * Download the source code of Egg Framework and extract somewhere
 * Import the project into your IDE - in Eclipse M2E use _File/Import/Existing Maven Projects_ and select the extracted directory
 * run the class _framework.Server_ located in _src/main/java_ - the embedded server with sample code will be started 
 * go to http://localhost:8080
 * check the source code in [src/main/java/controllers/SampleController.java](EggFramework/blob/master/src/main/java/controllers/SampleController.java) class
